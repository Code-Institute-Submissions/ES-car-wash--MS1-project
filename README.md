# **ES-car-wash--MS1-project**
The inspiration for this project came from my experience of working with a Valeting company some years ago. This is an imaginary website built to enable anyone who wants to clean their cars able to see the type of services we render and be able to book online inorder to reduce the waiting time to clean their cars.
# **UX**
This site was designed with mobile first approach in mind. The pages were designed so that it can be easy to navigate. The images and color used was to make it more eye catchy.
I identified two(but are not limited to) users of this website:
* New customers.
* Existing customers.
### **user stories**

* As a new customer I should be able to see the type of services rendered, opening hours, contact, photo gallery and online reviews.
* As an existing customer I should be able to book an appointment online.
